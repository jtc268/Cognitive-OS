## Methodology

- Each model received the same system message and the same user prompt documented in `prompts.md`.
- No model-specific prompt adaptation was used.
- Raw outputs are preserved separately from analysis in `raw_outputs/`.
- `collection_manifest.json` records model IDs, response IDs, timestamps, and token usage returned by the provider.
- `validation_report.md` records acceptance-criteria coverage, manifest consistency checks, credential scan result, and SHA-256 hashes for the raw output files.
- Analysis files were written after collection by comparing the preserved outputs against the issue's requested dimensions and the public Cognitive-OS repository structure.

## Limitations

- OpenRouter is an aggregator, so provider routing details beyond the model ID and response ID are limited to OpenRouter's returned metadata.
- Some models produced denser or shorter outputs than requested; these were preserved as-is rather than padded.
- This packet is architecture research for AGI-direction planning. It does not claim Cognitive-OS is currently AGI.
- Payment, review, and acceptance are controlled by the repository maintainer.
